# 🚀 feat: Complete REST API endpoints for proof management

## 📝 Description

This pull request implements comprehensive REST API endpoints for proof creation, verification, and management with proper error handling and security measures as specified in issue #3.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Proof Creation Endpoint** - Create new cryptographic proofs with full validation
- ✅ **Proof Verification Endpoint** - Verify proofs using hash and/or Stellar blockchain verification  
- ✅ **User Proof Management** - Query, filter, and paginate user proofs
- ✅ **Batch Proof Operations** - Perform bulk operations (verify, delete, update) on multiple proofs
- ✅ **Rate Limiting and Security** - Multi-tier rate limiting and input validation
- ✅ **API Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation with examples
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Security Features
- Multi-tier rate limiting (general, creation, verification, batch operations)
- Input validation using express-validator
- Hash integrity verification
- Expiration date handling
- Stellar address format validation
- UUID validation for user and proof IDs

- Implemented with full validation
- Hash integrity verification
- Proper error handling
- Returns created proof with metadata

### ✅ GIVEN verification request, WHEN made, THEN returns proof validity
- Multiple verification methods (hash, Stellar, both)
- Updates proof status accordingly
- Handles expired proofs
- Returns verification results

### ✅ GIVEN user query, WHEN requested, THEN returns user's proofs
- Filtering by user ID and other criteria
- Pagination support
- Sorting options
- Performance optimized

### ✅ GIVEN batch request, WHEN processed, THEN handles multiple operations
- Supports verify, delete, update operations
- Returns detailed success/failure results
- Proper error handling for individual items

### ✅ GIVEN rate limit, WHEN exceeded, THEN returns proper error response
- Multi-tier rate limiting implemented
- Clear error messages with retry information
- Different limits for different operation types

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Proof Management
- `POST /api/proofs` - Create new proof (rate limited: 10/min)
- `GET /api/proofs/:id` - Get specific proof
- `PUT /api/proofs/:id` - Update proof
- `DELETE /api/proofs/:id` - Delete proof
- `POST /api/proofs/:id/verify` - Verify proof (rate limited: 30/min)

### Query & Operations
- `GET /api/proofs` - Get user proofs with filtering/pagination
- `POST /api/proofs/batch` - Batch operations (rate limited: 5/5min)
- `GET /api/proofs/stats` - Get proof statistics

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Rate Limiting
- **General API**: 100 requests/15 minutes
- **Proof Creation**: 10 requests/minute
- **Proof Verification**: 30 requests/minute
- **Batch Operations**: 5 requests/5 minutes

### Input Validation
- Stellar address format validation (56 characters, starts with 'G')
- UUID validation for user and proof IDs
- Hash format validation (64-128 hex characters)
- Date validation for expiration dates
- JSON schema validation for request bodies

## 🧪 Testing
